It provides a fair amount of knowledge in several technologies that are heavily demanded in the market nowadays. It equips you with the proper tools to navigate the course...Read Morewith ease, allowing you to focus on what is important: learning. BUT, this is not a miraculous solution; it all depends on your dedication and time. You still need to learn A LOT on your own if you want to succeed quickly (I've been working on my programming skills almost like a full-time job since I started the bootcamp, and it took me 6 months after finishing it to land a job). Don't get me wrong: this is the same for every bootcamp. It's impossible to reach a professional level in programming in just 3 months by only attending classes. That being said, if you think you have the time and the strength, 4Geeks is just an amazing academy. Not only do they teach you the skills, but they also teach you how to keep learning. Also, I probably wouldn't have had this job opportunity if it weren't for the amazing career support they provide after the course. Now I know how to navigate this world, and that's just as valuable as the skills themselves. I absolutely recomend you to check what they have to offer!Read Less"

As a matter of fact, their price for the same online course varies from 3850-4600 if you pay upfront, whereas...Read Morethe representative was trying to sell me on the plan for 5300 telling me that he just applied some 1k discount to make it sound like a good deal. When I noticed when the website says and mentioned to him, on the next day he offered me to pay 4500. Overall, everything on their website is super confusing i.e. ""*Discount up to €1700. From €4600 instead of €6300"" or ""pay upfront and get a discount"", but turns out there is no additional discount. Anyhow, when I called him out on this later and tried to clarify how they come up with their prices, he avoided the question, got very rude and demanded that I pay up 6300 for the whole thing. On top of everything, this is a coding bootcamp, but they have failed to provide a safe payment system online and instead ask to make a weird wire transfer, or pay with crypto, which is super sketchy. They say you can pay by card, but that is actually not the case. These people just can't be trusted.Read Less"

Jorge Luis Pardo Rodríguez,2022,5/31/2022,5/31/2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,Overall,"For the past 16 weeks, I have been learning how to completely develop a web application at 4Geeks, and I have really enjoyed it.

Subsequently, the training focused on interacting with APIs, before creating one with SQLAlchemy, Python, and Flask. As well, we learned how to limit access to the API information. The last part of the course was a four-week final project that consisted of building a complete web application that put all the knowledge learned in the course to the test through a stream on the academy's YouTube channel. In each class, we had a teacher and an assistant who taught us the bases to carry out the exercises of the program meticulously. I have also benefited from unlimited mentoring provided by the school, which helped me to strengthen my knowledge and resolve any doubts I had throughout the bootcamp. In my opinion, the most valuable aspect of the academy is that all the teachers and mentors have been very willing to thoroughly teach me the content and to ensure that I understand the technologies. It's an atmosphere that's focused on total collaboration and helping you learn as much as possible (even remotely). 4Geeks is a great place to learn how to program, and with dedication on your part, you will surely learn a great deal about programming.Read Less"

En este momento, si bien está sujeto a cambios para mantenerse siempre a la vanguardia del mercado, se enseña JavaScript con React para el desarrollo Frontend y Python con Flask para el desarrollo Backend, además de otras herramientas y conocimientos básicos, siendo estas tecnologías unas de las más demandadas (si no las más) en el actual mercado laboral del desarrollo. Si bien el curso es intenso y exigente, 4Geeks Academy ofrece mucho más de lo que demanda y, sin duda, puede ser el punto de inflexión perfecto en la vida de muchas personas que, como yo, opten por dar un giro radical a su vida haciendo un cambio de carrera y accediendo a uno de los mercados más grandes (y con mejores sueldos) en la actualidad. Además de esto, cabe destacar que, no solo cuentan con profesores y mentores muy bien preparados, si no que ofrecen apoyo para la búsqueda de empleo (incluyendo preparación para las temidas entrevistas técnicas) y un sistema de mentorías vitalicio, con lo que siempre podrás contar con el apoyo de la academia, incluso tiempo después de haber concluido la formación básica en ella.Read Less"

Alan Staub Negro,2022,4/13/2022,4/13/2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,Overall,"The pros are that you will have a large community supporting you. At the beginning you will be almost alone in the new world of programming when you do the pre-work for the course. However, once you get to know your teacher and the rest of the students...Read Moreyou will gradually realize that this seemingly lonely environment is actually a community where we all face the same challenges. We all support each other gradually, of course at the beginning you will be somewhat reticent, reserved, because it is not normal to find yourself in a world where community support is the norm and being alone, reserved, isolated without helping others or being helped is the least usual, although you can opt for that path, but I warn you that it will not be easy to opt for that path. This is a path of challenges, defeats that soon become triumphs. At the beginning you feel helpless and incapable but as you advance, you overcome stagnations and generate those euphoric victories, you become addicted to this world of programming. Of course, all this is thanks to the immense support that you have from all sides along the bootcamp, you forget that you are in remote because as soon as you ask for help, (yes, you have to get used to confess something as difficult as ""I can't, I'm stuck, I don't see the error"" and they tell you, you are missing a semicolon in that line) all the mechanisms move in your favor to convert into victories those jams that seem to have no end. In conclusion, this bootcamp delivers like no other. It teaches you to be passionate about this world, but it also makes you wonder if this is really the path you want to follow. Because no matter how smart you are, this river only flows if you are really determined to move forward without fear of waterfalls. The teachers and mentors are wonderful, at least the one I had, Emanuel Martinez, taught me more than any of my teachers throughout my life. Victor and Marcos make things clear and always encourage you to keep going despite everyone. The treatment is personal, the platforms are ready to be used, and they help you at all times, even when they let you hit the ground with your face. After finishing the bootcamp they help you build a resume you would have never imagined, perfect your linkedin and know well what you need to do to get the attention of recruiters. And rest assured that if you don't know how to tackle a programming or job search problem you have lifetime mentoring, the 4Geeks Slack community that is IMMENSE and all the support of your mentors at your disposal. The best investment of my entire life. Thanks to this bootcamp my life finally has a way to go after being more than 5 years spinning from one job to another like a spinning top.

Crystle,2022,4/13/2022,4/13/2022,5.0,5.0,5.0,Overall,"I’ve been wanting to learn how to code but never found the time with a full time job, but then I saw 4GeeksAcademy offering a part time full stack bootcamp, and decided to spend a few hard months to learn. The part time structure was with 1 mentor and...Read More1 assistant throughout the whole course for each lesson of 3 hours, 3 times a week, with a flip classroom concept of students are to learn before the class, and listen to explanation in class after already having gone through the material. The bootcamp has a good structure easing in the ‘coding mindset’ with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and eventually SQL and Python. If I were to give a negative feedback, it would be that the slowly easing in front end was making it rather easy to digest, but when it came to backend and endpoints, it was rather rushed comparing to the frontend part of the course - although I have to say I wasn’t an example student studying coding hardcore pushing everyday. For a full time working person, this is manageable, although I missed a few classes while traveling, Marta the mentor of my bootcamp offered mentorship sessions, to explain topics that I missed. I would definitely recommend - hours wise this is perfect for someone working full time office hours, although the 3x3 hours per week is not to be taken lightly - students are expected to learn and code on their own outside of the classes, to be able to follow the designed learning path. Mentors and assistants are very nice and friendly, passionate about coding as well as getting people to learn - the course also creates a great community within the class of ~6 people in my case, I believe it’s maximum 14 people in one class. There’s also lifetime support on the slack channels, finding a job, or just mentorship on anything. On the finance side, I have to say they offer a rather considerate support, they are in partnership with a payment/credit company, students can choose to pay in installments, as small as 100 euros a month, and obviously paying in full also works.

Tenía dudas antes de incribirme sobre si, de verdad, iban a ser mentorías ilimitadas. La verdad es que incluso incentivan que las tomes y que sean todas las que necesitan.En cuanto al contenido, al ver las opciones de trabajo, te das cuenta que muchas piden las tecnologías que aprendiste en el bootcamp. Eso es muy grato de ver, después de haber invertido tiempo y dinero en un bootcamp.El acompañamiento de por vida se agradece, sobretodo cuando vas a empezar con las entrevistas y tienes que preparar el CV y hacer las cartas para aplicar. Tienen sesiones personalizadas para hacer entrevistas ficticias y para ayudarte a preparar para todas las entrevistas. Te ayudan en todo.Es un programa muy completo que cubre todo lo que necesitas para empezar o actualizarte en el mundo del desarrollo de software.Sin duda, muy contento. Recomiendo totalmente este bootcamp!Read Less"

Sean Warfman,2019,11/21/2019,11/21/2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,Overall,"After having researched 4Geeks, Wyncode, and IronHack, I settled on 4Geeks due to small class sizes, instructors' professional experience, and overall atmosphere. The smaller class atmosphere, I think, was far and away the largest advantage. I believe...Read Morewe had a 3-1 ratio of instructors to students which made for a fantastic learning environment considering the naturally frustrating challenges when learning to program. When I was learning on my own prior to the bootcamp, said challenges would often halt my progress and force me to take at least a few days of rest. With the support of mentors and experienced professionals immediately available (namely our teacher, Nacho), I was able to overcome such obstacles more quickly and with less energy spent on being upset. What's more, however, is I felt 4Geeks truly facilitated that ""A-ha!"" moment in programming to connect the dots. When you learn on your own, you often find yourself doing isolated exercises like learning how to write a for loop or an if-statement, etc., but don't really understand the point of those expressions outside of the immediate problem. 4Geeks, though, is absolutely phenomenal at piecing together concepts, expressions, and object-oriented programming for students. As a result, those formerly isolated exercises start to fit into the larger picture and once some clarity/understanding emerges you only become more interested, more invested, and more motivated to learn as much as possible and put your understanding to work in real-world applicable projects. I'm completely thrilled with the knowledge, experience, opportunities, and support 4Geeks continues to offer me and could not possibly have asked for more.Read Less"

William Boakye,2019,10/1/2019,10/1/2019,5.0,5.0,5.0,Overall,"What attracted me to 4Geeks Academy originally was the option of attending a part time cohort. For me, it meant I was able to continue my professional uninterrupted by a 3-4 month full-time course. I went in Mon & Wed 6-9 and Sat 9-12.Starting the cohort...Read Morewas a bit overwhelming for me as I had to get used to retraining myself how to approach a problem. The instructors at the academy do a pretty good job at trying to minimize the learning curve, but in reality they can only do so much with ~4 months of time to play with. Being a part-time course, a good portion of the learning falls on you and your motivation in your personal time. A lot of the assignments were the type where you learn *just* enough in class to go home and apply it yourself. Then, come back to the next class with any questions or concerns. There were absolutely times that were frustrating, and those frustrating moments hit everyone at different points. Luckily the team was very supportive/encouraging, and we managed to develop a kind of support group within the classmates.The course focused heavily on JavaScript/Reactjs for a large chunk of the time which, looking back, I appreciate because it’s the thing that I fell back on the most during the job interview that I got hired in. If you’re wondering whether they can teach you how to code - the answer is yes, but you have to put in a considerable amount of effort and time as well. They’ll lead you to the stream but you have to be the one to drink. 4Geeks has a well developed ecosystem of online resources as well as their knowledgeable staff that’ll do everything in their power to make sure you can surmount new topics and concepts. What’s was crazy for me was, because of imposture syndrome, (which you’ll likely have) I didn’t realize how much I had learned and was capable of until the very end when I had a functional final project that I was showing off to my peers.Above all, though, the most personally valuable skill I gained from the course was learning *how* to learn and teach myself. If I had been told that learning to learn would be one of my major take-always before signing up, I probably would have rolled my eyes. In reality, though, yes learning how to code is a big accomplishment (and with effort, you will), but in such a quickly evolving tech landscape where everything you need to know is available for free online, the most powerful tool you can have is your ability to pick up new skills and tricks to evolve with it. From what I saw, 4Geeks was working behind the scenes to make sure you gained that ability before they set you off into the world.4Geeks hosts in-house meetups with local business from time-to-time to introduce their students to the industry. They’re a good opportunity make connections with local leaders as well as network with new and former 4Geeks students. I’ve heard of some students leveraging them to land interviews.I managed to get hired for my first tech job just a little before graduating (so I can’t personally speak on post-grad job support) which was great and very possible, but not exactly the norm. A few of my classmates also recently got hired within a few months after graduating (one of which I know what’s receiving job support from the academy). What’s amazing is after graduating I’d come back to 4Geeks whenever there was something that I couldn’t figure out at the new job and they (Alejandro and others) would *always be willing to set aside time for me and smooth out my confusions.All-in-all I would definitely recommend 4Geeks with the caveat that you only get out of it what you put in. However, if you’re motivated to change your life and can weather some inevitably stressful moments, you’ll do fine and be well positioned to transition into tech.Read Less"

This was due in large part to our instructor Jonathan who was encouraging, friendly, and engaging, and made it clear that there was no such thing as a ""dumb question"" in his class. He and the TAs Andy and Angelo were also always available on Slack for questions outside of class, as well as the rest of the 4Geeks community (the #publicsupport channel on Slack is a great place to ask questions). This course was the catalyst for an entire career change for me, and I'm excited to look for my first dev job now. Regarding curriculum, I would have liked to spend a bit more time on backend languages. We studied PHP in this particular course, but our larger projects were more robust on Javascript/React (which I'm also glad I learned!). But with that being said, this particular course was only 3 months and so there is only so much subject matter you can meaningfully squeeze in. Overall it was a good balance for the time that we had.Read Less"
